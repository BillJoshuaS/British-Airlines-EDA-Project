# British-Airlines-EDA-Project
In this project we have explored the monthly surveillance, flight activity frequency and customer reviews and rating of the British Airlines bulk dataset using MySQL as local data repository to store the raw CSV files and the data transformation have been done with Python and SQL queries. Transformed data is then visualized using PowerBI.
